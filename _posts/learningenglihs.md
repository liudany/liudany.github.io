Have you tried turning it off and on again?

Why are you giving me the secret signal to shut up?

I don't wanna be rude or anything, but I wasn't informed of any changes to this department.

We are more than capable of taking care of ourselves.

I think we're gonna `get on` great.

I can see why you didn't want to use the word 'plan'.

I was just wondering(wang zhuen), do you want me to `connect up` your phone?

We were just wondering now that you're the boss, would you like us to access the data supplier and connect you up to the matrix?

How can I help?

You just `made all that up`.

You don't know anything about computers, `admit it`!

Will you stop trying to undermine me! Now get in there, and do some work, to do with computers! I'll be in there in a minute and check up on you!

Hong on guys, how can I help?

OK lady. You've won this round, but we can wait. You will slip up one day, and believe you me, we will be there when you do! There will be some piece of evidence that will prove (without any shadow of a doubt) that you don't know anything about computers!

What are you doing?

Plugging in your computers.

It might be something you say, or something you do. But when we notice this, and believe me we will notice this. There's gonna be a long way down for you, sweet chicks!

I cannot believe, you're going to `tell on`(tailing) me.

Why did you come here` in the first place`.

We set up a voice activation system on your computers. It might just `take a little while` to get the pitch right on your voice, but `nonetheless, go ahead!` Thank you very much!

I'd be `delighted`! I'm just `working on` a very simple piece of programming code

treat people with a little bit respect

got them `in a sale`.

I'm never lucky enough to `get a bargain` myself.

You just `defuse that entire situation`.

does that happen a lot? They're `fairly regular`.

Maybe I could help with this, you know, I'm a `people person`. People like you need a person to deal with people.

Ideas are coming.

If i tould you that I have a plan to raise your profile upstairs by 100%
