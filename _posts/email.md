Your application should be accompanied by a 3-5 page research statement. This should incorporate **a brief description of the general research areas and topics that interest you,** as this may be used to select suitable academics to whom your application will be circulated. Note that, although this document could also include to **a brief personal statement on your motivation** to pursue a PhD, its main purpose is to discuss the research problems that you wish to investigate.

Your research statement should also discuss:

1.  motivation for the research (i.e. why the topic is important for the scientific community and/or the broader society),
2.  research issues you intend to address during your PhD and
3.  your initial ideas on the research methodology (e.g. what sort of simulation or experimental techniques) you intend to pursue to address the research issues.

The research statement should **refer to existing scientific literature** using bibliographic references and should be your own original work.

The research statement does not constitute a commitment to carry out the exact research work that you have described, as this may change after acceptance and discussions with your supervisor.
